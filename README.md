# Ride Analysis Project
## Overview
This project aims to analyze ride data from various ride-hailing services to gain insights into urban mobility patterns and identify optimization opportunities. The analysis focuses on factors such as ride duration, distance, purposes, and start-stop patterns.

## Features
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and characteristics of the ride data.
Clustering analysis to identify common patterns and clusters within the data.
Visualization of key insights and findings.
Recommendations for improving efficiency and optimizing ride-hailing services.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
git clone https://github.com/melvin-ngure/Ride_Hailing_Data_Analysis.git

2. Open and run the ride_sharing_analysis.py script to perform the analysis.
python ride_sharing_analysis.ipynb

3. View the generated visualizations and insights in the output folder.
